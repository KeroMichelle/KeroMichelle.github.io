  <p>
  &quot;I Got You Now!&quot; is a collaborative mystery game of betrayal and destroyed trust. Mrs. Caldwell has discovered that her husband is a dirty liar and a cheat! With the suspects narrowed down to three friends, Mrs. Caldwell's objective is to expose the mistress. The non-guilty friends must help bring the mistress to justice while trying to prove their innocence. The true mistress, however, must avoid being caught and redirect suspicion to a different player!

  <h2><b><orange>The Academy of Magic</orange></b></h2>

  <p>
  The Academy of Magic is a custom module for Basic Edition Dungeons & Dragons set in a magic prep school, that satirically blends traditional fantasy lore with contemporary class and race commentary. Over the course of 3 weeks, I worked with 3 other students to create and playtest an original 17-page module with thematically consistent sets, props, costumes, and scripts.

  <h2><b><orange>Hardmode Parenting</orange></b></h2>

  <p>
  Hardmode Parenting is a competitive, resource-collection game. Players assume the roles of overbearing parents, fighting to get their six-year-old child admitted into the nation’s most prestigious prep school. There is only one spot remaining and the parents are willing to do anything to ensure that their child is admitted… even if that means subjecting your own child to cruelty and sabotaging the other children.
