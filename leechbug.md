Leechbug is an action-adventure roguelike game with a focus on strategic combat and environmental storytelling. The player is a robot parasite who must recruit a swarm of alien fish, defeat powerful creatures, and uncover the secrets of a long-lost civilization. Each species is armed with a unique attack, active and passive abilities, and distinctive personality, rewarding swarm synergy and deliberate gameplay. Combat is unforgiving but satisfying, and each run presents a different series of challenges.
