### Lead Producer | Team of 28 | Spring 2020 - Present

Leechbug is an action-adventure roguelike game with a focus on strategic combat and environmental storytelling. The player is a robot parasite who must recruit a swarm of alien fish, defeat powerful creatures, and uncover the secrets of a long-lost civilization. Each species is armed with a unique attack, active and passive abilities, and distinctive personality, rewarding swarm synergy and deliberate gameplay. Combat is unforgiving but satisfying, and each run presents a different series of challenges. Leechbug is set to release in May 2021.

As **lead producer**, I work alongside the development team and creative director to define project scope, make production schedules, and manage weekly Jira sprints.

Responsibilities:
* Utilize Waterfall methodology to organize production roadmaps and meet project milestones
* Employ Agile and Kanban scheduling methods to assign and track tasks on Jira
* Organize and manage art and audio pipelines to ensure assets are completed on time and at acceptable quality
* Proactively identify blocks to ensure all dependencies are being met and communicated
* Reorganize design and engineering development pipelines to facilitate cross-discipline collaboration and quality assurance
* Work with teams to resolve problems and adjust production schedules as needed
* Conduct weekly progress and wellness check-ins with a remote multidisciplinary team of 28 students
