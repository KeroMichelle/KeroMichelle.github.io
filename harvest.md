Harvest is a first-person psychological thriller game that forces its player to reconcile with the corporeal manifestations of their repressed guilt. Carden (the player character) must solve puzzles to unlock details of his past and make amends with his loved ones. Armed with only a few matches and his cigarette lighter, Carden will navigate through the rooms and floors of a sinister hotel that mirror his progression through the seven stages of grief.

Responsibilities:
* Organized development roadmaps to account for scope, milestones, resources, and dependencies
* Wrote narrative beats and designed core mechanics to direct player progression through the levels
* Crafted environments and interactions to achieve emotional goals and evoke player self-reflection
