  <p>
  InfuriRacing is a resource management racing game with a twist! All the vehicles are mom cars and they're infuriatingly bad >:D Players must collect tokens and strategically split them between five attributes (acceleration, brakes, robustness, steering, and fuel) to make it to little Timmy's soccer match and beat all the other moms. Along the way, they will encounter random misfortunes, or disruptive events that deplete their resources, forcing them to make tough decisions while maintianing control of the wheel.

  <h2><b><orange>Crafty Conquest</orange></b></h2>

  <p>
  Crafty Conquest is a 3v3 multiplayer, capture the flag style game about creativity, strategy, and teamwork. Each match is split into two phases: stage building and combat. The teams first spend 3-5 minutes constructing their half of the map and setting up their defenses. Then, the players engage in PvP combat to capture their opponents' flag, while defending their own. With custom stages, special combat items, and different character classes, each match offers a uniquely creative and tactical challenge.
